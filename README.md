# CSS Grid Layout

CSS grid layout or CSS grid is a technique in CSS that allows web developers to create complex responsive web design layouts more easily and consistently across browsers.

## Define a grid

To define a Grid use display:grid or display:inline-grid on the parent element.

```
display: grid | inline-grid | subgrid;
```

**Note:** column, float, clear, and vertical-align have no effect on a grid container.
